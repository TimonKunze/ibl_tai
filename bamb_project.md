1. Download data
2. Plot psychometric curves
    - over time for training data?
3. Measure metrics:
    - response bias:  estimated from the horizontal position of the psychometric curve, maximum absolute value of <16% contrast
    - contrast sensitivity: estimated by slope of psychometric curve, maximum threshold (1/sensitivity) of 19% contrast
    - lapse rates: (estimated from the asymptotes of the psychometric curve) maximum of 0.2 for their sum
